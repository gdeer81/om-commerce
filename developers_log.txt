This is where I will keep my notes for this project

Day 1:
no lein templates to speak of for a new om application so I just followed the quickstart tutorial to get set up

The first thing that strikes me is about building a Single Page Application is that after you've written your first index.html file, you're done creating html files
you only get one as the name implies

So before I write my first component I need to know how I'm going to set up navigation.
To start off with I'll try a simple home and about section

I'll use compassus (https://github.com/anmonteiro/compassus) for my routing

For now I've decided to copy-pasta sample code from the compassus docs.

Next I'll try to modify that code to create a secure route and a login page.
